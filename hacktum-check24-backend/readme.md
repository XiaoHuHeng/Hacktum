# Local Database Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to restore the PostgreSQL database from a backup file. This is useful for setting up a local development environment that mirrors the production database.

## Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL: Make sure PostgreSQL is installed on your system. You can download it from [PostgreSQL official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

## Database Restoration Steps

1. **Install PostgreSQL**:

   - If you haven't already, install PostgreSQL on your machine. Instructions can be found on the PostgreSQL website.

2. **Open Command Line Tool**:

   - On Windows, open Command Prompt.
   - On Linux or macOS, open Terminal.

3. **Connect to PostgreSQL**:

   - Use the `psql` command-line utility to connect to your PostgreSQL server:
     ```
     psql -U postgres
     ```

4. **Create a New Database**:

   - In the `psql` prompt, create a new database for the restoration:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE local_db;
     ```

5. **Restore the Database**:
   - Exit the `psql` prompt by typing `\q`.
   - Restore the database using the backup file. Ensure that you replace `path_to_your_backup_file.sql` with the actual path to your backup file:
     ```
     psql -U postgres -d local_db -f path_to_your_backup_file.sql
     ```

## Configuration

- The default username for the database is set to `postgres`. If your setup requires a different username, adjust the commands accordingly.
- Ensure that the database name `local_db` and the paths used in the commands match your local setup.

## Data Privacy and Security

- Ensure that the backup file does not contain any sensitive or private data before sharing.
- If the database contains specific schemas or functions, make sure they are included in the backup or provided as separate scripts.

## Testing the Setup

- It is recommended to test the restoration process in a clean environment to ensure that the instructions are accurate and the backup file is not corrupted.
